268. Missing Number

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array. 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2

Explanation:
n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2

Explanation:
n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8

Explanation:
n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

# - Calculate what the sum should be for numbers 0..n.
# - Subtract actual sum â†’ you're left with the missing number.
# - Elegant and very efficient!
